Description: Computationally efficient functions to provide direct likelihood-based
    inference for partially-observed multivariate birth-death processes.  Such processes
    range from a simple Yule model to the complex susceptible-infectious-removed model
    in disease dynamics.  Efficient likelihood evaluation facilitates maximum likelihood
    estimation and Bayesian inference.
